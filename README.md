# Advent of Code 2018

If you aren't already familiar, Advent of Code is a really fun yearly event
where a programmer named Eric Wastl sets up a website with a series of 
Christmas-themed programming puzzles. It's super fun! This repo contains
my code for solving the 2018 set of puzzles.

## Getting Started

You can find all of the details and stories surrounding the puzzles on the [Advent of Code Website](https://adventofcode.com/).

### Prerequisites

You should install python 3 and set up a virtual environment in order to use this codebase.

### Installing

**WIP** Getting to the point where you can just run `pip install .` in order to setup this python package.

### Formatting
**WIP** I'm currently using Python Black for strict formatting. Ideally this would be run using a pre-commit hook.

## Running the Tests

**WIP** Going to use pytest and incorporate mainly unit tests.
